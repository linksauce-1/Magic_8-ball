# Magic_9-ball v1.1 notes
A reworking of a little game I made in a summer camp for python way back when.

This is a silly little game that's a digital verison of a certain magic *insert number here*-ball.

A "fortune" now loads upon startup. After this, you have the option to "reshake" the ball or exit the program.

Enjoy!!
