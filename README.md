# Magic_8-ball v1.1 notes
A reworking of a little game I made in a summer camp for python way back when.

This is a silly little game that's a digital verison of a Magic 8-ball.

A "fortune" now loads upon startup. After this, you have the ability to "reshake" the ball or to exit the program.

Enjoy!!
