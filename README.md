# Magic_8-ball
A reworking of a little game I made in a summer camp for python way back when.

This is a silly little game that's a digital verison of a Magic 8-ball.
You hit return and it gives you wisdom/a fortune. After the intial response, you have the ability to "shake" the ball or to exit the program.

Enjoy
